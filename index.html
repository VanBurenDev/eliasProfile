        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p> Hey! I'm Elias Martinez, and I'm new to programming JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I love learning and look forward to the journey that lies ahead. </p>
        <p> Born in Phoenix, the city's sublime natural splendor and post-modern Southwest culture have remained my humble abode despite more than a few adventures abroad. The likes of which include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Taipei</li>
          <li>New York City</li>
          <li>Johannesburg</li>
          <li>Paris</li>
          <li>Cartagena</li>
        </ul>
        <p> I'm focused on developing and learning full-stack coding skills. This is because I have a passion for the web and creating virtual spaces that increase online activity and make a real sense of community. </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> The first website I visited was Simpsons.com; however, I didn't quite experience the site's full potential because of the nuances of dial-up connections. I played Warcraft III, Sims, Black & White, and subsequently dedicated many hours to World of Warcraft. When YouTube was becoming more mainstream, I spent a lot of time watching videos. I remember memes like rickrolling, Philosorapter, forever alone, RayWilliamJohnson (who was at the apex of =3), all your base belong to us, and piano cat - among others. </p>
        <p> I previously completed an undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering from Arizona State University. </p>

        <p> If I were to travel anywhere else, my top three would be:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Mexico City</li>
          <li>Manila</li>
          <li>Montenegro</li>
        </ol>
        <p> I have over nine years of professional experience. I enjoy reading digital newspapers, science fiction novels, and philosophical inquiry. I also keep current with the state of our nation. I have an adult dog who doesn't need so much attention these days, but I do like to walk with her when the weather is amenable. </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p> There are many, many ways to connect in today's internet age. I remember a time when one had to justify even adding an online component to the contact details. The advent of smaller processors, and handheld mobile devices, has made it that people connect extensively via apps or the web. Here are three ways to connect with me: </p>
