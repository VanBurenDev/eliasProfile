    <p> Hey! I'm Elias Martinez and I'm new to programming Javascript and HTML/CSS. I love learning and look forward to the journey that lay ahead.</p>
<!-- I wanted to add a profile picture here and add some words about myself -->

    <p> Born in Phoenix, the city's sublime natural splendor and post-modern Southwest culture has remained my humble abode despite more than a few adventures abroad. The likes of which include: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Taipei</li>
      <li>New York City</li>
      <li>Johannesburg</li>
      <li>Paris</li>
      <li>Cartagena</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm focused on developing and learning full stack coding skills. This is because I have a passion for the web and creating virtual spaces the proliferate online activity, and really a sense of community.</p>

	  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="image-of-winding-desert-path.jpg" alt="Winding Desert Path" class="center2">


    <p>I just started learning to code in Javascript and now I'm learning HTML/CSS. I hope to gain sufficient skills to hold the title of full stack software developer.</p>
    <p>The very first website I ever visited was simpsons.com however I didn't quite experience the site because of the nature of dial-up connections and they weren't as stable as they are now. I played Warcraft III, Sims, Black & White, and subsequently dedicated many hours to World of Warcraft. When Youtube was becoming more mainstream I spent a lot of time watching videos. I remember memes like rick roll, philosorapter, forever alone, RayWilliamJohnson was at the apex of =3, all your base belong to us, piano cat - among others. </p>

    <p>I previously completed an undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering from Arizona State University.</p>

    <p> If I were to travel anywhere else my top three would be:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mexico City</li>
      <li>Manila</li>
      <li>Montenegro</li>
    </ol>

    <p> I have over nine years of professional experience. I enjoy reading digital newspapers, science fiction novels, and philosophical inquery. I also keep current with the state of our nation. I have an adult dog so she doesn't need so much attention these days but I do like to walk with her when the weather is ameanable.</p>

   <h2>Contact</h2>
   <p>There are many, many ways to connect in today's internet age. I remember a time when one had to justify even adding an online component to their contact details. The advent of better and smaller processers, and handheld mobile devices, has made it such that some people connect exclusively via apps or the web. Here are three ways to connect with me:</p>

   <h2>Projects</h2>
   <h3>Find Vaccines App</h3>
   <p>The purpose of the website is to search to help the citizenry become immunized and prevent any further spread of COVID-19, permanently. The app will be minimal and wonâ€™t require user input beyond an initial session of 5 minutes or less.</p> <p>The stacks used here were ruby, html/css, and javascript.</p>
